    <shortdesc>Apache Kylin is an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse for Big Data.</shortdesc>
    <description>Apache Kylin is an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse for Big Data; it was designed to provide OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) capability in the big data era. By renovating the multi-dimensional cube and precalculation technology on Hadoop and Spark, Kylin is able to achieve near constant query speed regardless of the ever-growing data volume. Reducing query latency from minutes to sub-second, Kylin brings online analytics back to big data.</description>
